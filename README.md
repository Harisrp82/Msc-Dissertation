This dissertation meticulously examines the efficacy of deep learning models in forecasting the Nifty 50 stock index, a pivotal metric within India's equity markets. Rigorous analysis is conducted on three distinct models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and an innovative Hybrid model amalgamating both architectures.  Within the realm of conventional metrics, the GRU model demonstrates exceptional precision, while a discerning visual analysis reveals the LSTM model's predictions to align remarkably well with actual stock values. This observation underscores the nuanced and intricate nature of stock forecasting, where traditional metrics may offer an incomplete perspective.  
Beyond a comparative assessment of model performance, the dissertation illuminates the potential of deep learning in the realm of stock market predictions. It underscores the imperative for comprehensive evaluation methodologies and advocates for the integration of diverse data streams to enhance the robustness and accuracy of forecasting endeavors.  Embark on an exploration of the intersection between finance and artificial intelligence, gaining insights into the evolving landscape of stock market prediction through this scholarly dissertation. The findings contribute not only to the advancement of forecasting methodologies but also advocate for the continual exploration of innovative approaches in future research endeavors.
